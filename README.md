# OpenData AutobahnApi 
This project fetches public data provided by the [Autobahn Api](https://autobahn.api.bund.dev/) from [Bundesstelle Open Data](https://bund.dev/) and uses it for analysis. I was looking for a straight forward OpenData API without any APIkey requirement. AutobahnAPI matched all those criteria.
# Usage
This project has a two step approach. <li>First step is getting familiar with endpoints and the data they provide. See file [OpenDataAutobahnAPI](https://github.com/gems2tech/OpenDataAutobahnApi/blob/main/OpenDataAutobahnAPI.ipynb)<br> I made a get request for each endpoint provided and stored the JSON response in a file for further analysis in order not to send out too many API get requests thus preventing my IPAdress getting blocked. You can find those files in the directory filesJson.<li>Second step is working with the data provided. See file [OpenDataAutobahnAPIpandas](https://github.com/gems2tech/OpenDataAutobahnApi/blob/main/OpenDataAutobahnAPIpandas.ipynb)<br> Using the file OpenDataAutobahnAPIpandas you can either pick out the information you want from the JSON file or view the JSON file in a table using Pandas.<br>In both files OpenDataAutobahnAPI and OpenDataAutobahnAPIpandas only few variables of the code are changing. This means you could use them to make an interactive browser application with Dash to pick out the information you need and visualize them on a browser. Or some other use case you have in mind. Fork this project and do whatever you want with it. Have a look at the github projects of [Bundesstelle Open Data](https://github.com/bundesAPI).
